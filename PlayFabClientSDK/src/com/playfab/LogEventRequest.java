	/// <summary>
	/// A unique event name which will be used as the table name in the Redshift database. The name will be made lower case, and cannot not contain spaces. The use of underscores is recommended, for readability. Events also cannot match reserved terms. The PlayFab reserved terms are 'log_in' and 'purchase', 'create' and 'request', while the Redshift reserved terms can be found here: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_pg_keywords.html.

	public String eventName;
	
	/// <summary>
	/// Contains all the data for this event. Event Values can be strings, booleans or numerics (float, double, integer, long) and must be consistent on a per-event basis (if the Value for Key 'A' in Event 'Foo' is an integer the first time it is sent, it must be an integer in all subsequent 'Foo' events). As with event names, Keys must also not use reserved words (see above). Finally, the size of the Body for an event must be less than 32KB (UTF-8 format).
